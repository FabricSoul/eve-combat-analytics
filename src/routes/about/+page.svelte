		<h1>About EVE Combat Analytics</h1>

		<p>
			EVE Combat Analytics is a powerful tool designed to help EVE Online players analyze their
			combat performance using in-game combat logs. By processing and visualizing this data, the
			site provides valuable insights to help pilots understand their strengths, identify areas for
			improvement, and optimize their gameplay strategies.
		</p>

		<p>
			As an avid EVE Online player and developer, I created EVE Combat Analytics to fill a gap in
			the community. I saw a need for an accessible, user-friendly platform that could make sense of
			the wealth of data contained in combat logs. By leveraging my expertise in data analysis and
			web development, I aimed to create a tool that would be beneficial to both new and veteran
			players alike.
		</p>

		<p>
			At EVE Combat Analytics, our mission is to empower the EVE Online community with the knowledge
			and insights they need to excel in combat. We believe that by providing players with a deeper
			understanding of the underlying mechanics and trends in their combat encounters, we can help
			them become better, more effective pilots.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are committed to continually improving and expanding the capabilities of EVE Combat
			Analytics based on community feedback and the ever-evolving meta of EVE Online. If you have
			any suggestions, questions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
		</p>
